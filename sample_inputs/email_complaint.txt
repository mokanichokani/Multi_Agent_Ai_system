Subject: Urgent: Issue with recent order #12345

Hi Support,

I am writing to complain about my recent order #12345. The product arrived damaged, and it's not functioning as expected.
This is extremely frustrating as I needed it for an important project.
I demand a replacement or a full refund immediately! Please contact me on 555-123-4567 to resolve this. This is unacceptable.

Regards,
Jane Smith
